# Framed
Work in progress. Collaborative (network) drawing application.  
Build using c++ & libcinder. Runs on OSX, Windows & Linux.  
Pen pressure support on OSX & Windows tested on Wacom & Huion hardware but should run with other pen-based devices.

# Installation
Download latest binary from the **[Releases](https://github.com/lab101/Framed/releases )** for your platform.  
Choose the framed.zip from assets.

If you work on OSX there will be a lot of security issues.
1. you need to allow the downloaded file in the filevault
2. the app can't access to assets folder because it runs in quarontine.Move the app to a different folder and than back to the original location. After this osx will mark it as a safe file.

Check the **[this video](https://vimeo.com/508517646 )** on how to do the above.
